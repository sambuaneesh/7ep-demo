| Component Name | Responsibility | Interfaces (key endpoints or methods) | Depends On (other modules) | Technologies (frameworks, DBs, patterns) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication & User Management** | Manages user identity, registration, login, and password validation. | `POST /register`<br>`POST /login` | Persistence Layer (`IPersistenceLayer`) | Java Servlets, SHA-256 (hashing), `me.gosimple.nbvcxz` (password strength) |
| **Library Management** | Manages book and borrower records, and the transactional process of lending books. Provides search and listing capabilities. | `POST /registerbook`<br>`POST /registerborrower`<br>`POST /lend`<br>`GET /library-books-search`<br>`GET /library-books-available`<br>`GET /library-borrowers-search` | Persistence Layer (`IPersistenceLayer`) | Java Servlets, Domain-specific enums (`LibraryActionResults`) |
| **Mathematical Calculations** | Provides stateless, computationally intensive mathematical calculations as a service. | `POST /math`<br>`POST /fibonacci`<br>`POST /ackermann` | None (self-contained) | Java Servlets, `java.math.BigInteger`, Recursive & Iterative algorithms |
| **System Administration** | Exposes administrative functions to manage the database schema state, primarily for automated testing. | `GET /flyway?action=<clean|migrate>` | Persistence Layer (`IPersistenceLayer`), Flyway | Java Servlets, Flyway |
| **Auto Insurance Calculator (Desktop)** | A standalone thick client that calculates insurance premium adjustments based on driver age and claims history. | Custom text-based TCP socket server on port 8000 (commands: `set age`, `set claims`, `get label`, `click calculate`) | None (standalone) | Java Swing, Custom TCP Server, Rules Engine pattern |
| **Persistence Layer (DAL)** | Acts as the single gateway for all database interactions for the web application. Implements a custom micro-ORM. | `IPersistenceLayer` (programmatic interface with methods like `saveNewUser`, `searchBooksBy...`, `createLoan`, `cleanAndMigrateDatabase`) | H2 Database, Flyway | JDBC, H2, Flyway, Custom Micro-ORM |
| **CI/CD & Testing Pipeline** | Automates the build, multi-framework testing (unit, BDD, E2E), static/dynamic security analysis, and deployment process. | Jenkinsfile stages. Interacts with `GET /flyway` for test environment setup. | System Administration component (for DB reset), SonarQube, OWASP ZAP, JMeter | Jenkins, Gradle, Selenium, Cucumber, Pytest, SonarQube, OWASP ZAP & DependencyCheck, JMeter, Pitest |
