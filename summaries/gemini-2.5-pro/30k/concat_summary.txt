=== summary_chunk_1.txt ===

An architectural summary of the provided codebase chunk is below, structured for microservice decomposition analysis.

### 1. Overall System Architecture

This codebase consists of two primary applications: a monolithic Java web application and a standalone Java Swing desktop application. The project serves as a demonstration vehicle for various software development, testing, and CI/CD practices.

*   **Technology Stack**:
    *   **Web Backend**: Java 8+, raw Servlets (no Spring/Jakarta EE), Gretty for local development.
    *   **Web Frontend**: Basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
    *   **Desktop**: Java Swing.
    *   **Database**: H2 (in-memory/file-based).
    *   **Build/Dependencies**: Gradle, Pipenv (for Python test dependencies).
    *   **CI/CD**: Jenkins (`Jenkinsfile`), SonarQube, JMeter, OWASP DependencyCheck.
*   **Architectural Style**: The web application is a classic **Monolith**, bundling multiple distinct business domains into a single deployable WAR file. It exhibits a simple **Layered Architecture** (Presentation/Servlet -> Business Logic -> Data Access). The desktop application is a standalone executable.

### 2. Component: Web Application Monolith (`/src`)

This is the core application, containing several distinct business domains.

#### 2.1. Domains / Potential Microservices

##### 2.1.1. Authentication Domain
*   **Component Name**: `com.coveros.training.authentication`
*   **Responsibilities**: Manages user registration and login.
*   **API Endpoints** (`web.xml`):
    *   `POST /demo/register`: Registers a new user.
        *   Request Parameters: `username`, `password`
        *   Implementation: `RegisterServlet.java` -> `RegistrationUtils.java`
    *   `POST /demo/login`: Authenticates a user.
        *   Request Parameters: `username`, `password`
        *   Implementation: `LoginServlet.java` -> `LoginUtils.java`
*   **Data Models**:
    *   `User.java`: `(long id, String name)` - Represents a registered user.
    *   `RegistrationResult.java`, `PasswordResult.java`: DTOs encapsulating the result of operations.
*   **Dependencies**: Tightly coupled with the shared `PersistenceLayer`.
*   **Microservice Candidate**: **Strong**. This is a self-contained, critical function (Identity and Access Management) that is a prime candidate for extraction into a dedicated `AuthService`.

##### 2.1.2. Library Domain
*   **Component Name**: `com.coveros.training.library`
*   **Responsibilities**: Manages a simple library system for books, borrowers, and loans.
*   **API Endpoints** (`web.xml`):
    *   `POST /demo/registerbook`: Adds a new book title. (Param: `book`)
    *   `POST /demo/registerborrower`: Adds a new borrower. (Param: `borrower`)
    *   `POST /demo/lend`: Records a book being loaned to a borrower. (Params: `book`, `borrower`)
    *   `GET /demo/books`: Lists all available books.
    *   `POST /demo/listbooks`: Searches for books by title. (Param: `search`)
    *   `POST /demo/listborrowers`: Searches for borrowers by name. (Param: `search`)
*   **Business Logic**: `LibraryUtils.java` centralizes all library-related operations like searching, registration, and lending.
*   **Data Models**:
    *   `Book.java`: `(long id, String title)`
    *   `Borrower.java`: `(long id, String name)`
    *   `Loan.java`: `(long id, Book book, Borrower borrower, Date checkoutDate, Date returnDate)`
*   **Dependencies**: Tightly coupled with the shared `PersistenceLayer`.
*   **Microservice Candidate**: **Strong**. This is a clear, cohesive business domain with its own data and logic, suitable for extraction into a `LibraryService`.

##### 2.1.3. Mathematics Domain
*   **Component Name**: `com.coveros.training.mathematics`
*   **Responsibilities**: Provides endpoints for various mathematical calculations.
*   **API Endpoints** (`web.xml`):
    *   `POST /demo/math`: Adds two integers. (Params: `item_a`, `item_b`)
    *   `POST /demo/ack`: Calculates the Ackermann function. (Params: `item_a`, `item_b`)
    *   `POST /demo/fib`: Calculates a Fibonacci number. (Param: `item_a`)
*   **Business Logic**: Contains stateless, pure functions for calculations (`Calculator.java`, `Ackermann.java`, `Fibonacci.java`).
*   **Data Models**: None; operates on primitive types.
*   **Dependencies**: None.
*   **Microservice Candidate**: **Medium**. As a set of stateless, computational utilities, it could be a `CalculatorService`. However, its simplicity means it could also remain a shared library.

#### 2.2. Cross-Cutting Concerns

##### 2.2.1. Persistence Layer
*   **Component Name**: `com.coveros.training.persistence`
*   **Responsibilities**: Acts as a generic Data Access Layer (DAL) for the entire monolith, abstracting direct JDBC calls.
*   **Interfaces**: `IPersistenceLayer.java` defines the data access contract (e.g., `saveNewUser`, `getBooks`, `createLoan`).
*   **Implementation**: `PersistenceLayer.java` provides the concrete implementation using raw JDBC, managing connections and executing hand-written SQL. It acts as a **Data Mapper**. No ORM (like JPA/Hibernate) is used.
*   **Key Challenge for Decomposition**: This shared layer is a major point of coupling between all domains. Splitting the monolith requires breaking this component apart, giving each new microservice its own dedicated persistence logic and database connection.
*   **Utility Endpoint**: `GET /demo/db?action=clear` provides a way to wipe the database, used for testing.

##### 2.2.2. Database Schema
*   **Framework**: **Flyway** (`/src/main/resources/db/migration`) is used for database versioning and migrations.
*   **Tables**:
    *   `users`: `id` (PK), `name` (UNIQUE) - *Used by Authentication*
    *   `books`: `id` (PK), `title` - *Used by Library*
    *   `borrowers`: `id` (PK), `name` - *Used by Library*
    *   `loans`: `id` (PK), `book` (FK), `borrower` (FK), `checkout_date`, `return_date` - *Used by Library*
*   **Key Challenge for Decomposition**: The domains currently share a single database schema. A microservice architecture would require splitting this into separate schemas/databases, one per service, to ensure data autonomy.

#### 2.3. Frontend
*   **Component Name**: `/src/main/webapp`
*   **Responsibilities**: Provides a simple user interface and static documentation for the API.
*   **Key Files**:
    *   `index.html`: Main entry point.
    *   `library.html`, `library.js`: UI for interacting with the library domain.
    *   `endpointcatalog.html`: Static HTML documentation of the available API endpoints.
    *   `WEB-INF/web.xml`: The application's deployment descriptor, mapping URL patterns to Java Servlet classes.

---

### 3. Component: AutoInsurance Desktop Application (`/desktop_app`)

*   **Responsibilities**: A standalone GUI application that calculates auto insurance premium adjustments based on driver age and number of previous claims.
*   **Key Components**:
    *   `AutoInsuranceUI.java`: The main View class, built with **Java Swing**. It is the application entry point (`main` method).
    *   `AutoInsuranceProcessor.java`: The core business logic (the "Model"). It contains a stateless `process(claims, age)` method that implements the calculation rules.
    *   `AutoInsuranceAction.java`: A DTO that represents the result of a calculation (premium increase, warning letter, policy cancellation).
*   **Service Dependencies**: None. It is fully self-contained with no database or external network calls.
*   **Communication Patterns**:
    *   **Unique Feature**: Implements a **custom test automation server** (`AutoInsuranceScriptServer.java`).
    *   **Mechanism**: On startup, it opens a `ServerSocket` on TCP port **8000**.
    *   **Interface**: It accepts plain-text commands (`set age 22`, `click calculate`, `get label`) to remotely control the UI components. This provides a scriptable API for the GUI, enabling robust automation without visual screen scraping.
*   **Microservice Candidate**: **Strong**. The core business logic in `AutoInsuranceProcessor` is stateless and well-defined. It could be extracted, wrapped in a REST API, and deployed as a `QuotingService`. The desktop app would then be refactored to be a client of this new service.

---

### 4. Configuration, Deployment, and Operations

*   **Build System**: **Gradle**. `gradlew` scripts and `gradle.properties` define the build environment. `README.md` documents key tasks like `apprun` (run webapp), `check` (run tests), `runAllTests` (run e2e tests).
*   **CI/CD Pipeline**: A comprehensive pipeline is defined in `jenkins/Jenkinsfile` and documented in `/docs/ci_and_cd`.
    *   **Orchestration**: Jenkins.
    *   **Triggers**: `git push` via a `post-receive` hook.
    *   **Stages**: The pipeline automates build, multi-level testing, static analysis, security scanning, and reporting.
*   **Deployment**: The web application is packaged as a WAR file and deployed to a servlet container (e.g., Tomcat). The `WebAppListener.java` class hooks into the servlet container's lifecycle to initialize the database connection pool.
*   **Testing Strategy**: The project has an extensive and multi-faceted testing strategy, which is critical for validating behavior before and after any decomposition effort.
    *   **Unit**: JUnit & Mockito (`/src/test`).
    *   **Integration**: `PersistenceLayerTests.java` tests the DAL against an H2 database.
    *   **API**: Python/pytest, Postman collection, SoapUI project, and curl scripts (`/src/api_tests`, `/docs/api_testing`).
    *   **BDD**: Cucumber/Gherkin tests for business features (`/src/bdd_test`).
    *   **UI (Web)**: Selenium with Behave (Python) (`/src/ui_tests`).
    *   **UI (Desktop)**: A custom client/server framework (`AutoInsuranceScriptClient`/`Server`).
    *   **Security**: OWASP DependencyCheck.
    *   **Performance**: JMeter.
    *   **Static Analysis**: SonarQube.

=== summary_chunk_2.txt ===

An architectural summary of the provided codebase chunk (Part 2 of 5) is provided below. This summary focuses on details relevant to microservice decomposition analysis.

### 1. Overall Architecture

The codebase chunk describes a monolithic Java web application with server-side rendering, designed as an educational tool. The architecture emphasizes a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline, extensive automated testing, and clear separation of concerns in the source code.

*   **Application Style**: Monolithic Web Application.
*   **Technology Stack**:
    *   **Backend**: Java
    *   **Application Server**: Apache Tomcat
    *   **Database**: H2 (used in both in-memory and file-based modes)
    *   **Build Tool**: Gradle 7.0
*   **Architectural Principles**:
    *   **Domain-driven packaging**: Code is organized into packages by business domain (e.g., `com.coveros.training.library`).
    *   **Centralized Persistence Layer**: All database access is funneled through a single component (`PersistenceLayer.java`).
    *   **Immutability**: Data structures are designed to be immutable where possible.
    *   **Avoidance of `null`**: A stated design goal to improve robustness.
    *   **Database Migrations**: FlywayDB is used for managing and versioning the database schema.

### 2. Component Breakdown & Responsibilities

The system can be logically divided into distinct business domains and a supporting DevOps infrastructure.

#### 2.1. Application Components (Business Domains)

These are potential candidates for microservices.

*   **Authentication Service**:
    *   **Responsibility**: Manages user registration and login.
    *   **Key Logic**: Handles username uniqueness checks and enforces password complexity rules (entropy-based).
    *   **Code Location**: `src/bdd_test/java/com/coveros/training/authentication/`, `src/bdd_test/resources/authentication/`

*   **Library Management Service**:
    *   **Responsibility**: Manages the core library functions: inventory of books, list of borrowers, and loans.
    *   **Entities**: `Book`, `Borrower`, `Loan`.
    *   **Key Logic**:
        *   CRUD operations for books and borrowers.
        *   Lending a book, which creates a `Loan` record and makes the book unavailable.
        *   Business rules: a book can only be loaned to one person at a time; only registered borrowers can check out books.
        *   Cascading deletes: Deleting a book or borrower also deletes any associated loans.
        *   Search and listing capabilities (e.g., list all books, list only available books).
    *   **Code Location**: `src/bdd_test/java/com/coveros/training/library/`, `src/bdd_test/resources/library/`

*   **Mathematical Utilities Service**:
    *   **Responsibility**: Provides various mathematical calculation capabilities.
    *   **Key Logic**:
        *   Integer addition.
        *   Ackermann's function calculation.
        *   Fibonacci number calculation.
    *   **Code Location**: `src/bdd_test/java/com/coveros/training/math/`, `src/bdd_test/resources/math/`

*   **Expense Calculation Service**:
    *   **Responsibility**: Calculates the alcohol-related portion of a restaurant bill.
    *   **Key Logic**: Splits a bill (subtotal, food total, tip, tax) into food and alcohol portions, correctly attributing the proportional tip and tax to the alcohol cost.
    *   **Code Location**: `src/bdd_test/java/com/coveros/training/expenses/`, `src/bdd_test/resources/expenses/`

#### 2.2. DevOps and Testing Infrastructure Components

These components support the development, testing, and deployment lifecycle of the application.

*   **`jenkinsbox` (CI/CD Server)**:
    *   **Responsibility**: The central hub for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery.
    *   **Components**: Jenkins, SonarQube, a local Git repository, H2O web server.
    *   **Details**: Runs on a CentOS 7 VM with a static IP (`192.168.56.101`). Jenkins orchestrates the entire build, test, and analysis pipeline. SonarQube provides static code analysis. The local Git repo uses a `post-receive` hook to trigger Jenkins builds automatically. H2O serves test reports.

*   **`uitestbox` (Test Environment Server)**:
    *   **Responsibility**: Hosts the running application for testing and provides tools for UI and security testing.
    *   **Components**: Apache Tomcat, OWASP ZAP, Google Chrome, Chromedriver, Python 3.7, Pipenv, Java 11.
    *   **Details**: Runs on a CentOS 7 VM with KDE desktop and a static IP (`192.168.56.102`). Tomcat runs the deployed application WAR. OWASP ZAP runs as a daemon proxy on port `8888` to perform security scanning during automated tests.

### 3. API Endpoints and Interfaces

The application exposes a set of HTTP endpoints. These are tested via Python scripts.

*   **Database Management**:
    *   `GET /demo/flyway`: Resets the database to a clean state by running Flyway migrations.
*   **Authentication**:
    *   `POST /demo/register`: Registers a new user.
        *   **Payload**: `username`, `password`
        *   **Response**: Contains `successfully registered: true` on success or error messages like `no password provided`.
    *   `POST /demo/login`: Authenticates a user.
        *   **Payload**: `username`, `password`
        *   **Response**: Contains `access granted` on success.
*   **Library Management**:
    *   `POST /demo/registerbook`: Adds a new book to the library.
        *   **Payload**: `book` (title)
        *   **Response**: `SUCCESS` or `ALREADY_REGISTERED_BOOK`.
    *   `POST /demo/registerborrower`: Adds a new borrower.
        *   **Payload**: `borrower` (name)
        *   **Response**: `SUCCESS` or `ALREADY_REGISTERED_BORROWER`.
    *   `POST /demo/lend`: Lends a book to a borrower.
        *   **Payload**: `borrower`, `book`
        *   **Response**: `SUCCESS` or `BOOK_CHECKED_OUT`.
*   **Utilities**:
    *   `POST /demo/math`: Adds two integers.
        *   **Payload**: `item_a`, `item_b`
        *   **Response**: The sum, or `Error: only accepts integers`.

### 4. Database Schema and Data Models

The schema is managed by FlywayDB. Based on the tests, the following entities can be inferred:

*   **`users` table**:
    *   `id` (PK)
    *   `name` (VARCHAR, UNIQUE)
    *   `hash` (VARCHAR, for storing hashed password)
*   **`books` table**:
    *   `id` (PK, auto-increment)
    *   `title` (VARCHAR)
*   **`borrowers` table**:
    *   `id` (PK, auto-increment)
    *   `name` (VARCHAR)
*   **`loans` table**:
    *   `id` (PK, auto-increment)
    *   `book` (FK to `books.id`)
    *   `borrower` (FK to `borrowers.id`)
    *   `checkout_date` (DATE)

### 5. Service Dependencies and Communication Patterns

*   **Runtime**: As a monolith, all components communicate in-process via Java method calls. There are no runtime network dependencies between the business components.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline**:
    *   **Git -> Jenkins**: A Git `post-receive` hook on `jenkinsbox` triggers a Jenkins build via the `jenkins-cli.jar` over HTTP (`http://localhost:8080/`).
    *   **Jenkins -> SonarQube**: The Jenkins pipeline executes a Gradle task (`sonarqube`) which sends analysis data to the SonarQube server running on the same box.
    *   **Jenkins -> `uitestbox`**: The pipeline deploys the application WAR file to the Tomcat instance on `uitestbox`.
    *   **Tests -> Application**: Automated tests (API, UI) running from the Jenkins agent communicate with the application on `uitestbox` via HTTP.
    *   **Tests -> ZAP -> Application**: Security-conscious tests (API, UI BDD) are configured to proxy their HTTP traffic through the OWASP ZAP instance on `uitestbox` for passive and active security scanning. The Jenkins pipeline collects the final report from ZAP via an HTTP call.

### 6. Key Business Logic and Algorithms

*   **Password Validation**: `RegistrationUtils.isPasswordGood(password)` checks password strength based on entropy, not just simple rules. Passwords that are too short, common, or have low entropy are rejected.
*   **Book Lending**: The `LibraryUtils.lendBook` method encapsulates the core logic: it checks if the book is available and if the borrower is registered before creating a loan record.
*   **Expense Calculation**: The `AlcoholCalculator` uses a ratio-based approach to distribute shared costs (tax and tip) proportionally between food and alcohol based on their subtotals.
*   **Mathematical Functions**: Standard implementations for Fibonacci and the recursive Ackermann function.

### 7. Configuration and Deployment Details

*   **Infrastructure**: The entire dev/test environment is built on VirtualBox VMs (`jenkinsbox`, `uitestbox`). The setup documentation is comprehensive, specifying OS (CentOS 7), networking (Host-only `192.168.56.0/24` subnet), memory, and disk sizes. Security is explicitly disabled (firewall, SELinux) for educational ease of use.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline (`Jenkinsfile`)**: This is the heart of the deployment process. It defines a multi-stage pipeline that automates:
    1.  **Build**: Compiling and packaging the application (`.war`).
    2.  **Testing**: Executes a full spectrum of tests: Unit, Integration (DB), BDD, API, UI (Java & Python/Behave), Performance (JMeter), and Mutation (Pitest).
    3.  **Analysis**: Static analysis (SonarQube) and dependency vulnerability scanning (OWASP DependencyCheck).
    4.  **Deployment**: Deploys the application to the `uitestbox` test environment.
    5.  **Reporting**: Collects and archives test results (JUnit XML format) and security reports (ZAP HTML).
*   **SSL/TLS**: A process is documented for creating self-signed certificates with `openssl` and configuring them in Tomcat's `server.xml` to enable HTTPS on port `8443`.

### 8. Architectural Patterns and Frameworks

*   **Data Access Object (DAO)**: The `PersistenceLayer.java` class acts as a centralized DAO, abstracting all database interactions.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline**: A mature pipeline-as-code pattern is implemented using a declarative `Jenkinsfile`.
*   **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**: Cucumber (Java) and Behave (Python) are used to align business requirements with tests, using Gherkin (`.feature`) files as the single source of truth for behavior.
*   **Security Scanning Proxy**: OWASP ZAP is used as a transparent proxy during testing to integrate security scanning directly into the functional testing process.
*   **Test Pyramid Implementation**: The codebase shows a clear and deliberate separation of test types (`unit`, `integration`, `api`, `ui`, `bdd`), reflecting a robust testing strategy.

=== summary_chunk_3.txt ===

An architectural summary of the provided codebase chunk (Part 3 of 5) is below. This summary is structured for microservice decomposition analysis, preserving critical details about components, data, APIs, and dependencies.

### 1. Overall Architecture

This codebase chunk represents a portion of a **Java-based monolithic web application**. It exposes business logic through a **Java Servlet API**. The architecture is layered, with Servlets acting as the entry point (Controller), utility classes (`*Utils`) containing business logic (Service), and a dedicated Persistence Layer (`PersistenceLayer`) acting as a Data Access Object (DAO) to handle all database interactions.

-   **Frameworks/Libraries**:
    -   Java Servlet API for web endpoints.
    -   SLF4J for logging.
    -   H2 Database for integration testing.
    -   Flyway for database schema migration (inferred from test setup and schema history table).
    -   **Nbvcxz**: A Java library for password strength estimation.
    -   JUnit and Mockito for testing.

### 2. Core Components & Responsibilities

The application is logically divided into distinct domains: **Authentication**, **Library Management**, **Mathematics**, and a core **Persistence** layer.

#### 2.1. Persistence Layer

This is the foundational component responsible for all database communication, abstracting SQL operations from the business logic.

-   **Component Names**:
    -   `IPersistenceLayer`: The crucial interface defining the contract for all data operations. This abstraction allows for mocking and dependency injection.
    -   `PersistenceLayer`: The concrete implementation of `IPersistenceLayer`. It manages JDBC connections, executes SQL queries, and maps results to domain objects.
    -   `DbServlet`: An administrative servlet providing endpoints to manage the database schema.

-   **Responsibilities**:
    -   Provide a centralized, abstracted API for all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
    -   Manage database connections (using `DataSource`).
    -   Handle database schema migrations using Flyway (`cleanDatabase`, `migrateDatabase`).
    -   Provide database backup and restore functionality for testing (`runBackup`, `runRestore`).

-   **API Endpoints**:
    -   `GET /flyway?action=clean`: Wipes all data and schema from the database.
    -   `GET /flyway?action=migrate`: Applies Flyway migration scripts to build the schema.
    -   `GET /flyway`: Default action is to clean and then migrate the database.

-   **Configuration & Deployment**:
    -   The integration tests configure a file-based H2 database: `jdbc:h2:./build/db/training;AUTO_SERVER=TRUE;MODE=PostgreSQL`.
    -   It uses SQL scripts stored in `src/integration_test/resources/db_sample_files/` to set up specific test data states.

#### 2.2. Authentication Domain

-   **Component Names**:
    -   `RegisterServlet`: Handles new user registration requests.
    -   `LoginServlet`: Handles user authentication requests.
    -   `RegistrationUtils`: Contains the business logic for registering a user, including password validation.
    -   `LoginUtils`: Contains the business logic for verifying user credentials.

-   **Responsibilities**:
    -   Register new users if the username is not already taken.
    -   Validate password strength and complexity during registration.
    -   Authenticate existing users against stored credentials.

-   **API Endpoints**:
    -   `POST /register`: Registers a new user.
        -   **Request parameters**: `username`, `password`.
        -   **Response**: A string indicating the result (e.g., "successfully registered", "already registered").
    -   `POST /login`: Authenticates a user.
        -   **Request parameters**: `username`, `password`.
        -   **Response**: "access granted" or "access denied".

-   **Key Business Logic & Algorithms**:
    -   **Password Strength Check (`RegistrationUtils.isPasswordGood`)**:
        -   Uses the `Nbvcxz` library to estimate password entropy and time-to-crack.
        -   Enforces minimum length (10 chars) and maximum length (100 chars).
        -   Rejects passwords that don't meet a minimum entropy threshold.
    -   **Registration Flow (`RegistrationUtils.processRegistration`)**:
        1.  Validates input.
        2.  Checks if the user already exists via `persistenceLayer.searchForUserByName`.
        3.  Validates password strength.
        4.  Saves the new user (`persistenceLayer.saveNewUser`) and then updates their password hash (`persistenceLayer.updateUserWithPassword`).

-   **Dependencies**:
    -   Both `RegistrationUtils` and `LoginUtils` have a direct dependency on `IPersistenceLayer` to interact with user data.

#### 2.3. Library Management Domain

This domain manages the core functionality of a library: books, borrowers, and loans.

-   **Component Names**:

        -   **Request parameters (optional)**: `id`, `name`. Returns a JSON array.
    -   `GET /listavailable`: Lists all books not currently on loan. Returns a JSON array.

-   **Key Business Logic (`LibraryUtils`)**:
    -   **Lending Logic (`lendBook`)**:
        1.  Verifies the book is registered.
        2.  Verifies the borrower is registered.
        3.  Verifies the book is not already on loan by calling `persistenceLayer.searchForLoanByBook`.
        4.  Creates a new loan record via `persistenceLayer.createLoan`.
    -   **Registration Logic (`registerBook`, `registerBorrower`)**:
        -   Checks if the entity already exists before creating a new one to prevent duplicates.

-   **Dependencies**:
    -   `LibraryUtils` has a strong dependency on `IPersistenceLayer` for all its operations.

#### 2.4. Mathematics Domain

A functionally independent domain providing various mathematical calculations.

-   **Component Names**:
    -   `MathServlet`, `AckServlet`, `FibServlet`: Servlets exposing the calculations.

-   **API Endpoints**:
    -   `POST /math`: Adds two numbers.
        -   **Request parameters**: `item_a`, `item_b`.
    -   `POST /ackermann`: Calculates Ackermann's function.
        -   **Request parameters**: `ack_param_m`, `ack_param_n`, `ack_algorithm_choice` (`tail_recursive` or default).
    -   `POST /fibonacci`: Calculates a Fibonacci number.
        -   **Request parameters**: `fib_param_n`, `fib_algorithm_choice` (`tail_recursive_1`, `tail_recursive_2`, or default).

-   **Dependencies**: This domain is self-contained and has **no dependency** on the persistence layer or other business domains.

### 3. Database Schema and Data Models

The database is split into three schemas: `ADMINISTRATIVE`, `AUTH`, and `LIBRARY`. This separation is a strong indicator for potential microservice boundaries.

#### 3.1. Schemas & Tables

-   **Schema: `AUTH`**
    -   **Table: `USER`**
        -   `ID` (INT, PK, Auto-increment)
        -   `NAME` (VARCHAR(100), NOT NULL)
        -   `PASSWORD_HASH` (VARCHAR(100))
-   **Schema: `LIBRARY`**
    -   **Table: `BOOK`**
        -   `ID` (INT, PK, Auto-increment)
        -   `TITLE` (VARCHAR(100), NOT NULL)
    -   **Table: `BORROWER`**
        -   `ID` (INT, PK, Auto-increment)
        -   `NAME` (VARCHAR(100), NOT NULL)
    -   **Table: `LOAN`**
        -   `ID` (INT, PK, Auto-increment)
        -   `BOOK` (INT, NOT NULL, FK -> `LIBRARY.BOOK.ID`)
        -   `BORROWER` (INT, NOT NULL, FK -> `LIBRARY.BORROWER.ID`)
        -   `BORROW_DATE` (DATE, NOT NULL)
-   **Schema: `ADMINISTRATIVE`**
    -   **Table: `flyway_schema_history`**: Standard Flyway table to track schema versioning.

#### 3.2. Data Models (Domain Objects)

-   **`com.coveros.training.authentication.domainobjects.User`**: Represents a system user. Maps to `AUTH.USER`.
    -   `long id`
    -   `String name`
-   **`com.coveros.training.library.domainobjects.Book`**: Represents a library book. Maps to `LIBRARY.BOOK`.
    -   `long id`
    -   `String title`
-   **`com.coveros.training.library.domainobjects.Borrower`**: Represents a person who can borrow books. Maps to `LIBRARY.BORROWER`.
    -   `long id`
    -   `String name`
-   **`com.coveros.training.library.domainobjects.Loan`**: Represents a loan transaction. Maps to `LIBRARY.LOAN`.
    -   `long id`
    -   `Book book`
    -   `Borrower borrower`
    -   `java.sql.Date checkoutDate`

### 4. Service Dependencies & Communication

-   **Internal Communication**: Standard Java method calls. The business logic (`*Utils`) classes are tightly coupled to the `IPersistenceLayer` interface. Servlets are coupled to their respective `*Utils` classes.
-   **External Communication**: All external communication is via HTTP through the Java Servlets. The REST-like GET endpoints for searching produce simple JSON arrays. The POST endpoints are form-based and redirect to a result page.
-   **Data Flow**: `Servlet` -> `*Utils` (Business Logic) -> `PersistenceLayer` -> `Database`.

### 5. Architectural Patterns & Analysis for Decomposition

-   **Architectural Pattern**: A classic **N-Tier Layered Monolith**.
-   **Decomposition Analysis**:
    -   **Candidate Service 1: `Authentication Service`**
        -   **Domain**: User registration and login.
        -   **Components**: `LoginServlet`, `RegisterServlet`, `LoginUtils`, `RegistrationUtils`.
        -   **Data**: Owns the `AUTH.USER` table.
        -   **Analysis**: Strong candidate. It has a clear, bounded context and its own data schema (`AUTH`).
    -   **Candidate Service 2: `Library Service`**
        -   **Domain**: Managing books, borrowers, and loans.
        -   **Components**: All `Library*` servlets and `LibraryUtils`.
        -   **Data**: Owns the `LIBRARY.BOOK`, `LIBRARY.BORROWER`, and `LIBRARY.LOAN` tables.
        -   **Analysis**: Very strong candidate. A well-defined domain with its own schema (`LIBRARY`).
    -   **Candidate Service 3: `Mathematics Service`**
        -   **Domain**: Performing complex mathematical calculations.
        -   **Components**: `MathServlet`, `AckServlet`, `FibServlet` and all calculation classes.
        -   **Data**: Stateless. It has no database dependencies.
        -   **Analysis**: Easiest candidate to extract. It's completely decoupled from the other domains and has no persistent state.
    -   **Shared Dependencies/Challenges**:
        -   Both the `Authentication` and `Library` domains currently reside in a single database. A decomposition would require either splitting the database or careful management of a shared one.
        -   There is an implicit link between a `User` and a `Borrower` (e.g., a librarian is a `User`, a patron is a `Borrower`). The current implementation does not link them, but in a real-world scenario, this relationship would need to be managed, possibly via an API gateway or inter-service communication (e.g., the Library Service querying the Auth Service to validate a user before creating a borrower).

=== summary_chunk_4.txt ===

This document provides a comprehensive architectural summary of the codebase chunk 4 of 5, focusing on details relevant for microservice decomposition analysis.

### 1. Component Names and Responsibilities

This chunk primarily defines the persistence layer, database schema, and frontend UI for the application. It reveals a clear separation of concerns between authentication/user management and library operations.

**Backend Components (Java)**
*   **`PersistenceLayer`**: The primary Data Access Object (DAO) component. It implements the `IPersistenceLayer` interface.
    *   **Responsibilities**:
        *   Manages database connections using an H2 `JdbcConnectionPool`.
        *   Provides a "micro-ORM" for executing raw SQL queries, handling `PreparedStatement` creation, parameter binding, and `ResultSet` extraction.
        *   Contains all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for both the `Library` and `Authentication` domains.
        *   Implements business-critical data logic like password hashing (SHA-256).
        *   Integrates with `Flyway` to manage database schema migrations (clean, migrate).
        *   Provides database backup and restore functionality.
*   **`SqlData` & `ParameterObject`**: Helper classes for the `PersistenceLayer`'s micro-ORM.
    *   **Responsibilities**: Encapsulate a single SQL operation, including the prepared statement string, typed parameters (`ParameterObject`), and a function to extract results. This pattern reduces JDBC boilerplate code.
*   **`SqlRuntimeException`**: A custom unchecked exception for wrapping `SQLException`.
*   **`WebAppListener`**: A `ServletContextListener` that hooks into the Tomcat server's startup process.
    *   **Responsibilities**: To initialize the application state by cleaning and migrating the database using `Flyway` when the web application starts.

**Frontend Components (Webapp)**
*   **`library.html`**: The main user interface for the library application.
    *   **Responsibilities**: Provides forms for librarian login, librarian registration, lending books, registering new books, and registering new borrowers. Also includes buttons for database management (Clean/Migrate).
*   **`endpointcatalog.html`**: A developer-oriented UI for testing backend endpoints directly from the browser.
*   **`library.js`**: Client-side logic for `library.html`.
    *   **Responsibilities**: Enhances user experience with autocomplete functionality for book and borrower input fields. It fetches data by making asynchronous GET requests to `/listavailable` and `/borrower` endpoints.
*   **`catalog.js`**: Client-side logic for `endpointcatalog.html`.
    *   **Responsibilities**: Intercepts form submissions and sends them as AJAX requests, displaying the response directly on the page.
*   **`result.jsp` & `restfulresult.jsp`**: Simple JavaServer Pages for rendering responses from server-side operations.

**Database Components**
*   **Flyway Migration Scripts (`V1__...`, `V2__...`)**: SQL scripts that define and evolve the database schema.
    *   **Responsibilities**: Create and manage tables for authentication (`auth` schema) and library (`library` schema) functionalities, ensuring a consistent database structure.

**Testing Components**
*   **Unit/Integration Tests (`*Tests.java`)**: JUnit and Mockito tests for backend components, verifying business logic and servlet behavior in isolation.
*   **`SelenifiedSample.java`**: End-to-end tests using the Selenified framework. They simulate user interactions with the web UI (`library.html`) to validate full application flows like user registration and login.

### 2. API Endpoints and Interfaces

The API is primarily form-based and REST-like, inferred from HTML forms, JavaScript files, and servlet tests.

**Server-Side Interface (`IPersistenceLayer`)**
This interface defines the contract for all data access operations. Methods are separated by domain:
*   **Library Domain**: `saveNewBorrower`, `createLoan`, `saveNewBook`, `updateBorrower`, `deleteBook`, `deleteBorrower`, `getBorrowerName`, `searchBorrowerDataByName`, `searchBooksByTitle`, `searchBooksById`, `searchBorrowersById`, `listAllBooks`, `listAvailableBooks`, `searchForLoanByBorrower`, `searchForLoanByBook`.
*   **Authentication Domain**: `saveNewUser`, `searchForUserByName`, `areCredentialsValid`, `updateUserWithPassword`.
*   **Utility**: `runBackup`, `runRestore`, `cleanAndMigrateDatabase`.

**HTTP API Endpoints**
*   `POST /login`: Authenticates a librarian. Parameters: `username`, `password`.
*   `POST /register`: Registers a new librarian. Parameters: `username`, `password`.
*   `POST /lend`: Creates a loan record for a book and a borrower. Parameters: `book`, `borrower`.
*   `POST /registerbook`: Registers a new book. Parameter: `book`.
*   `POST /registerborrower`: Registers a new borrower. Parameter: `borrower`.
*   `GET /flyway`: Manages database state. Parameter: `action` (`clean`, `migrate`). Used for testing and setup.
*   `GET /console/*`: Exposes the H2 database management console.
*   `GET /listavailable`: Returns a JSON array of all available books. Used by `library.js` for autocomplete.
*   `GET /book`: Searches for books. Parameters: `id` or `title`. If no parameters, lists all books. Returns JSON.
*   `GET /borrower`: Searches for borrowers. Parameters: `id` or `name`. If no parameters, lists all borrowers. Returns JSON.
*   `POST /math`, `POST /fibonacci`, `POST /ackermann`: Additional endpoints exposed via `endpointcatalog.html`, likely implemented in other codebase chunks.

### 3. Database Schemas and Data Models

The database is an **in-memory H2 instance running in PostgreSQL compatibility mode**. The schema is managed by Flyway and is distinctly separated into two domains, a strong indicator for microservice decomposition.

**Database Schemas**
*   **`auth` Schema**:
    *   `USER` table:
        *   `id` (SERIAL, PRIMARY KEY)
        *   `name` (VARCHAR(100), NOT NULL)
        *   `password_hash` (VARCHAR(100))
*   **`library` Schema**:
    *   `BORROWER` table:
        *   `id` (SERIAL, PRIMARY KEY)
        *   `name` (VARCHAR(100), NOT NULL)
    *   `BOOK` table:
        *   `id` (SERIAL, PRIMARY KEY)
        *   `title` (VARCHAR(100), NOT NULL)
    *   `LOAN` table:
        *   `id` (SERIAL, PRIMARY KEY)
        *   `book` (INT, NOT NULL, FK to `library.BOOK.id`, ON DELETE CASCADE)
        *   `borrower` (INT, NOT NULL, FK to `library.BORROWER.id`, ON DELETE CASCADE)
        *   `borrow_date` (DATE, NOT NULL)

**Java Data Models (Domain Objects)**
*   `com.coveros.training.authentication.domainobjects.User`: Represents a librarian with `id` and `name`.
*   `com.coveros.training.library.domainobjects.Book`: Represents a book with `id` and `title`.
*   `com.coveros.training.library.domainobjects.Borrower`: Represents a library member with `id` and `name`.
*   `com.coveros.training.library.domainobjects.Loan`: Represents a lending record, composing `Book` and `Borrower` objects, plus `loanId` and `borrowDate`.

### 4. Service Dependencies and Communication Patterns

*   **Communication Style**: Client-Server. The frontend (browser) communicates with the backend (Tomcat server) via synchronous form posts and asynchronous AJAX/XHR requests.
*   **Architecture Pattern**: A classic **3-Tier/Layered Architecture**:
    1.  **Presentation Layer**: Frontend files (`.html`, `.js`, `.jsp`, Servlets).
    2.  **Business Logic Layer**: `*Utils` classes (inferred from tests), which contain the core application logic.
    3.  **Data Access Layer**: `PersistenceLayer`, which handles all database interactions.
*   **Internal Dependencies**:
    *   `WebAppListener` -> `PersistenceLayer` (at startup).
    *   Servlets -> `*Utils` classes.
    *   `*Utils` classes -> `PersistenceLayer`.
    *   `PersistenceLayer` -> H2 JDBC Driver, Flyway library.
*   **External Dependencies**: The system runs on a Java Servlet container like Tomcat.

### 5. Key Business Logic and Algorithms

*   **User Authentication**:
    *   Passwords are not stored in plaintext. They are hashed using **SHA-256** before being stored or compared in the `auth.USER` table.
    *   Login is verified by hashing the provided password and querying the database for a matching username and `password_hash`.
*   **Book Lending Logic**:
    *   A book can only be lent if the book exists, the borrower exists, and the book is not already on loan (checked by `searchForLoanByBook`).
*   **Database Migration**:
    *   The `WebAppListener` ensures that on every application start, the database is wiped clean (`flyway.clean()`) and then built from scratch using the SQL migration scripts (`flyway.migrate()`). This is suitable for a stateless, in-memory database setup.
*   **Micro-ORM Implementation**:
    *   The `PersistenceLayer` uses a template method pattern (`runQuery`, `executeUpdateTemplate`) with `SqlData` objects to abstract the repetitive steps of Java's JDBC API, improving code readability and maintainability.

### 6. Configuration and Deployment Details

*   **Deployment**: The application is packaged as a standard `.war` file and deployed to a Java Servlet container (e.g., Tomcat).
*   **Database Configuration**:
    *   **Type**: H2 In-Memory Database.
    *   **Mode**: PostgreSQL compatibility mode.
    *   **Connection URL**: `jdbc:h2:mem:training;MODE=PostgreSQL`.
*   **Application Server Configuration (`web.xml`)**:
    *   Configures the H2 database console to be accessible at the `/console/*` URL path.
    *   Sets session tracking to use cookies only, disabling URL rewriting for session IDs.
*   **Logging (`log4j2.xml`)**:
    *   Configured to log messages at the `INFO` level and above to the console.
*   **Testing Configuration (`selenified.properties`)**:
    *   Configures the Selenified E2E testing framework, specifying the browser (`Chrome`), base application URL (`http://localhost:8080/demo/`), and other test parameters.

### 7. Architectural Patterns and Frameworks

*   **Architectural Patterns**:
    *   **Layered Architecture**: As described in Section 4.
    *   **Data Access Object (DAO)**: The `PersistenceLayer` acts as a central DAO for the entire application.
*   **Frameworks & Libraries**:
    *   **Web**: Java Servlet API, JSP.
    *   **Database**: H2, JDBC, **Flyway** (for schema migration).
    *   **Testing**: **JUnit** (unit tests), **Mockito** (mocking), **Selenified** (browser-based E2E tests).
    *   **Utility**: Apache Commons Lang3 (for builders like `EqualsBuilder`, `ToStringBuilder`).
    *   **Logging**: Log4j2.

### Summary for Microservice Decomposition

The current architecture presents strong candidates for decomposition into at least two microservices:

1.  **Authentication Service**:
    *   **Domain**: Manages users (librarians), registration, and authentication.
    *   **Data**: Owns the `auth.USER` table.
    *   **Code**: `auth` package components, authentication-related methods in `PersistenceLayer`, `LoginServlet`, `RegisterServlet`, `LoginUtils`, `RegistrationUtils`.
    *   **API**: Would expose endpoints like `POST /register`, `POST /login`, `GET /users/{id}`.

2.  **Library Service**:
    *   **Domain**: Manages books, borrowers, and loans.
    *   **Data**: Owns the `library.BOOK`, `library.BORROWER`, and `library.LOAN` tables.
    *   **Code**: `library` package components, library-related methods in `PersistenceLayer`, and all library-related servlets.
    *   **API**: Would expose endpoints for CRUD operations on books/borrowers and for managing loans (e.g., `POST /loans`, `GET /books`, `GET /borrowers`).

The clear separation in the database schema (`auth` vs. `library`) is the most significant justification for this split. The frontend would need to be adapted to call these two new, independent services.

=== summary_chunk_5.txt ===

An architectural summary of this codebase chunk is provided below, focusing on details relevant to microservice decomposition. This chunk consists entirely of tests (unit, integration, and UI/E2E), which provides significant insight into the system's behavior, APIs, data models, and user-facing features.

### High-Level Overview

This codebase chunk reveals a monolithic Java web application with at least two distinct business domains: **Library Management** and **Mathematical Calculations**. It also exposes administrative capabilities for database management. The application is built using Java Servlets for the web layer and a custom SQL persistence layer. A comprehensive, polyglot testing strategy is in place, utilizing multiple languages and frameworks for UI end-to-end testing, which clearly defines the user workflows and API contracts.

---

### 1. Identified Business Domains & Capabilities

#### Domain A: Library Management & Authentication

This is the core business domain. It handles the management of books, borrowers, loans, and user authentication for librarians.

**Components & Responsibilities:**

*   **Domain Objects:**
    *   `Book`: Represents a book with `id` (long) and `title` (String).
    *   `Borrower`: Represents a person who can borrow books, with `id` (long) and `name` (String). It has a `toOutputString()` method that produces a JSON representation (`{"Name": "...", "Id": "..."}`).
    *   `Loan`: Represents a loan event, linking a `Book` and a `Borrower`. Contains `id` (long), `book`, `borrower`, and `borrowDate` (java.sql.Date).
    *   `User`: (Inferred from authentication tests) Represents a system user (e.g., a librarian) with `username` and `password`.
*   **Web Layer (Servlets - Inferred):**
    *   **AuthenticationServlet**: Handles user registration and login.
    *   **LibraryServlet**: Handles library operations like registering books, borrowers, and lending books.
*   **Persistence Layer:**
    *   `IPersistenceLayer`: An interface for database operations. The tests mock this, indicating it's a key dependency for business logic.

**API Endpoints & Interfaces (External Contract):**

The `ui_tests/java/src/test/java/com/coveros/training/ApiCalls.java` file and UI test implementations clearly define the following RESTful-like endpoints:

*   `POST /demo/register`: Registers a new user.
    *   **Request Body (form-data):** `username`, `password`
    *   **Response:** A string indicating success, e.g., containing "SUCCESSFULLY_REGISTERED".
*   `POST /demo/login`: (Inferred from UI tests) Logs in a user.
    *   **Request Body (form-data):** `login_username`, `login_password`
    *   **Response:** A string indicating success, e.g., containing "access granted".
*   `POST /demo/registerbook`: Registers a new book.
    *   **Request Body (form-data):** `book` (the title)
    *   **Response:** HTML page showing result.
*   `POST /demo/registerborrower`: Registers a new borrower.
    *   **Request Body (form-data):** `borrower` (the name)
    *   **Response:** HTML page showing result.
*   `POST /demo/lendbook`: (Inferred from UI tests) Creates a loan.
    *   **Request Body (form-data):** `lend_book`, `lend_borrower`
    *   **Response:** HTML page with `id="result"` containing "SUCCESS".

**Key Business Logic & Workflows:**

*   **User Registration & Login:** A standard authentication flow.
*   **Book Lending Workflow:**
    1.  A librarian registers a `Book`.
    2.  A librarian registers a `Borrower`.
    3.  A librarian lends the book to the borrower, creating a `Loan`.
*   **Dynamic UI Logic:** The UI for lending books (`library.html`) changes based on the number of books/borrowers in the system:
    *   **0:** The input field is locked/disabled.
    *   **1-9:** A `<select>` dropdown is displayed.
    *   **10+:** An autocomplete text input is displayed.

---

#### Domain B: Mathematical Calculations

This is a stateless, computational domain, completely separate from the Library domain.

**Components & Responsibilities:**

*   **Logic Components:**
    *   `Ackermann`/`AckermannIterative`: Calculates Ackermann's function using recursive and iterative methods. Uses `BigInteger` for large results.
    *   `Fibonacci`/`FibonacciIterative`: Calculates Fibonacci numbers using recursive and multiple iterative algorithms. Uses `BigInteger` for large results.
    *   `Calculator`: (Inferred from tests) Performs simple arithmetic like addition.
*   **Web Layer (Servlets):**
    *   `AckServlet`: Exposes Ackermann calculation via a web endpoint.
    *   `FibServlet`: Exposes Fibonacci calculation via a web endpoint.
    *   `MathServlet`: Exposes simple addition via a web endpoint.

**API Endpoints & Interfaces:**

*   `POST /ack`: (Inferred from `AckServletTests`) Calculates Ackermann's function.
    *   **Request Body (form-data):** `ack_param_m`, `ack_param_n`, `ack_algorithm_choice` (`regular_recursive`, `tail_recursive`).
*   `POST /fib`: (Inferred from `FibServletTests`) Calculates a Fibonacci number.
    *   **Request Body (form-data):** `fib_param_n`, `fib_algorithm_choice` (`regular_recursive`, `tail_recursive_1`, `tail_recursive_2`).
*   `POST /math`: (Inferred from `MathServletTests`) Adds two numbers.
    *   **Request Body (form-data):** `item_a`, `item_b`.

---

#### Domain C: System Administration

This domain provides administrative functions, primarily for database management during development and testing.

**Components & Responsibilities:**

*   `DbServlet`: A servlet that provides endpoints for database lifecycle control.
*   `WebAppListener`: A `ServletContextListener` that automatically initializes the database on application startup.

**API Endpoints & Interfaces:**

*   `GET /demo/flyway`: (Used extensively in UI tests) Resets the database.
*   `GET /db`: (Inferred from `DbServletTests`) The servlet's endpoint.
    *   **Query Parameter:** `action` with values `clean`, `migrate`. The default action is to clean and migrate.

**Key Business Logic & Workflows:**

*   **Database Initialization:** On application startup, the `WebAppListener` invokes `cleanAndMigrateDatabase()` on the persistence layer. This suggests the use of a database migration tool like Flyway.
*   **On-Demand DB Reset:** The `/demo/flyway` endpoint allows for resetting the database state, which is critical for repeatable E2E tests.

---

### 2. Data Models & Schemas

Based on the domain objects and persistence tests, the following database tables are inferred:

*   **`books` table:**
    *   `id`: BIGINT, PRIMARY KEY
    *   `title`: VARCHAR
*   **`borrowers` table:**
    *   `id`: BIGINT, PRIMARY KEY
    *   `name`: VARCHAR
*   **`loans` table:**
    *   `id`: BIGINT, PRIMARY KEY
    *   `book_id`: BIGINT, FOREIGN KEY to `books.id`
    *   `borrower_id`: BIGINT, FOREIGN KEY to `borrowers.id`
    *   `borrow_date`: DATE
*   **`users` table:**
    *   `id`: BIGINT, PRIMARY KEY
    *   `name`: VARCHAR, UNIQUE (for username)
    *   `password`: VARCHAR (presumably hashed)

The `SqlData` and `ParameterObject` classes indicate a custom-built mechanism for creating and executing parameterized SQL queries.

---

### 3. Cross-Cutting Concerns & Architectural Patterns

*   **Overall Architecture:** A monolithic application built on the Java Servlet specification.
*   **Deployment:** Deployed as a single web application (likely a `.war` file) into a servlet container like Tomcat. The application runs at `http://localhost:8080/demo/`.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   Database connection details are configured somewhere outside this code chunk.
    *   The Java UI tests use a `gradle.properties` file to configure settings like `chromedriver.path`.
*   **Architectural Patterns:**
    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** The Python Selenium tests (`basic_test.py`) explicitly use the POM pattern to create a reusable and maintainable abstraction over the UI. This is a best practice in UI automation.
    *   **Facade/Gateway (for testing):** The `ApiCalls.java` class acts as a client-side facade to the application's API, simplifying test setup.
*   **Testing Strategy:**
    *   **Unit Testing:** Java unit tests are written with JUnit and Mockito. `EqualsVerifier` is used to enforce `equals` and `hashCode` contracts on domain objects.
    *   **Parameterized Tests:** JUnit's `Parameterized` runner is used for testing algorithms (`Ackermann`, `Fibonacci`) with multiple inputs.
    *   **UI/E2E Testing:** A polyglot approach is used for end-to-end testing, indicating a sophisticated CI/CD pipeline or multiple teams with different skillsets.
        *   **Java:** Selenium WebDriver and HtmlUnit (for headless, non-JS tests).
        *   **Python (Behave):** BDD-style tests written in Gherkin syntax, providing living documentation of system features.
        *   **Python (Pytest):** Standard imperative UI tests using Selenium.
        *   **JavaScript:** Mocha and Selenium WebDriver.
        *   **C#:** NUnit and Selenium WebDriver.
*   **Service Dependencies:** The primary external dependency is a relational database. The application also depends on a database migration tool (inferred to be Flyway).
