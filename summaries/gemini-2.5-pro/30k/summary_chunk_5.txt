An architectural summary of this codebase chunk is provided below, focusing on details relevant to microservice decomposition. This chunk consists entirely of tests (unit, integration, and UI/E2E), which provides significant insight into the system's behavior, APIs, data models, and user-facing features.

### High-Level Overview

This codebase chunk reveals a monolithic Java web application with at least two distinct business domains: **Library Management** and **Mathematical Calculations**. It also exposes administrative capabilities for database management. The application is built using Java Servlets for the web layer and a custom SQL persistence layer. A comprehensive, polyglot testing strategy is in place, utilizing multiple languages and frameworks for UI end-to-end testing, which clearly defines the user workflows and API contracts.

### 1. Identified Business Domains & Capabilities

#### Domain A: Library Management & Authentication

This is the core business domain. It handles the management of books, borrowers, loans, and user authentication for librarians.

**Components & Responsibilities:**

*   **Domain Objects:**
    *   `Book`: Represents a book with `id` (long) and `title` (String).
    *   `Borrower`: Represents a person who can borrow books, with `id` (long) and `name` (String). It has a `toOutputString()` method that produces a JSON representation (`{"Name": "...", "Id": "..."}`).
    *   `Loan`: Represents a loan event, linking a `Book` and a `Borrower`. Contains `id` (long), `book`, `borrower`, and `borrowDate` (java.sql.Date).
    *   `User`: (Inferred from authentication tests) Represents a system user (e.g., a librarian) with `username` and `password`.
*   **Web Layer (Servlets - Inferred):**
    *   **AuthenticationServlet**: Handles user registration and login.
    *   **LibraryServlet**: Handles library operations like registering books, borrowers, and lending books.
*   **Persistence Layer:**
    *   `IPersistenceLayer`: An interface for database operations. The tests mock this, indicating it's a key dependency for business logic.

**API Endpoints & Interfaces (External Contract):**

The `ui_tests/java/src/test/java/com/coveros/training/ApiCalls.java` file and UI test implementations clearly define the following RESTful-like endpoints:

*   `POST /demo/register`: Registers a new user.
    *   **Request Body (form-data):** `username`, `password`
    *   **Response:** A string indicating success, e.g., containing "SUCCESSFULLY_REGISTERED".
*   `POST /demo/login`: (Inferred from UI tests) Logs in a user.
    *   **Request Body (form-data):** `login_username`, `login_password`
    *   **Response:** A string indicating success, e.g., containing "access granted".
*   `POST /demo/registerbook`: Registers a new book.
    *   **Request Body (form-data):** `book` (the title)
    *   **Response:** HTML page showing result.
*   `POST /demo/registerborrower`: Registers a new borrower.
    *   **Request Body (form-data):** `borrower` (the name)
    *   **Response:** HTML page showing result.
*   `POST /demo/lendbook`: (Inferred from UI tests) Creates a loan.
    *   **Request Body (form-data):** `lend_book`, `lend_borrower`
    *   **Response:** HTML page with `id="result"` containing "SUCCESS".

**Key Business Logic & Workflows:**

*   **User Registration & Login:** A standard authentication flow.
*   **Book Lending Workflow:**
    1.  A librarian registers a `Book`.
    2.  A librarian registers a `Borrower`.
    3.  A librarian lends the book to the borrower, creating a `Loan`.
*   **Dynamic UI Logic:** The UI for lending books (`library.html`) changes based on the number of books/borrowers in the system:
    *   **0:** The input field is locked/disabled.
    *   **1-9:** A `<select>` dropdown is displayed.
    *   **10+:** An autocomplete text input is displayed.

#### Domain B: Mathematical Calculations

This is a stateless, computational domain, completely separate from the Library domain.

**Components & Responsibilities:**

*   **Logic Components:**
    *   `Ackermann`/`AckermannIterative`: Calculates Ackermann's function using recursive and iterative methods. Uses `BigInteger` for large results.
    *   `Fibonacci`/`FibonacciIterative`: Calculates Fibonacci numbers using recursive and multiple iterative algorithms. Uses `BigInteger` for large results.
    *   `Calculator`: (Inferred from tests) Performs simple arithmetic like addition.
*   **Web Layer (Servlets):**
    *   `AckServlet`: Exposes Ackermann calculation via a web endpoint.
    *   `FibServlet`: Exposes Fibonacci calculation via a web endpoint.
    *   `MathServlet`: Exposes simple addition via a web endpoint.

**API Endpoints & Interfaces:**

*   `POST /ack`: (Inferred from `AckServletTests`) Calculates Ackermann's function.
    *   **Request Body (form-data):** `ack_param_m`, `ack_param_n`, `ack_algorithm_choice` (`regular_recursive`, `tail_recursive`).
*   `POST /fib`: (Inferred from `FibServletTests`) Calculates a Fibonacci number.
    *   **Request Body (form-data):** `fib_param_n`, `fib_algorithm_choice` (`regular_recursive`, `tail_recursive_1`, `tail_recursive_2`).
*   `POST /math`: (Inferred from `MathServletTests`) Adds two numbers.
    *   **Request Body (form-data):** `item_a`, `item_b`.

---

#### Domain C: System Administration

This domain provides administrative functions, primarily for database management during development and testing.

**Components & Responsibilities:**

*   `DbServlet`: A servlet that provides endpoints for database lifecycle control.
*   `WebAppListener`: A `ServletContextListener` that automatically initializes the database on application startup.

**API Endpoints & Interfaces:**

*   `GET /demo/flyway`: (Used extensively in UI tests) Resets the database.
*   `GET /db`: (Inferred from `DbServletTests`) The servlet's endpoint.
    *   **Query Parameter:** `action` with values `clean`, `migrate`. The default action is to clean and migrate.

**Key Business Logic & Workflows:**

*   **Database Initialization:** On application startup, the `WebAppListener` invokes `cleanAndMigrateDatabase()` on the persistence layer. This suggests the use of a database migration tool like Flyway.
*   **On-Demand DB Reset:** The `/demo/flyway` endpoint allows for resetting the database state, which is critical for repeatable E2E tests.

### 2. Data Models & Schemas

Based on the domain objects and persistence tests, the following database tables are inferred:

*   **`books` table:**
    *   `id`: BIGINT, PRIMARY KEY
    *   `title`: VARCHAR
*   **`borrowers` table:**
    *   `id`: BIGINT, PRIMARY KEY
    *   `name`: VARCHAR
*   **`loans` table:**
    *   `id`: BIGINT, PRIMARY KEY
    *   `book_id`: BIGINT, FOREIGN KEY to `books.id`
    *   `borrower_id`: BIGINT, FOREIGN KEY to `borrowers.id`
    *   `borrow_date`: DATE
*   **`users` table:**
    *   `id`: BIGINT, PRIMARY KEY
    *   `name`: VARCHAR, UNIQUE (for username)
    *   `password`: VARCHAR (presumably hashed)

The `SqlData` and `ParameterObject` classes indicate a custom-built mechanism for creating and executing parameterized SQL queries.

### 3. Cross-Cutting Concerns & Architectural Patterns

*   **Overall Architecture:** A monolithic application built on the Java Servlet specification.
*   **Deployment:** Deployed as a single web application (likely a `.war` file) into a servlet container like Tomcat. The application runs at `http://localhost:8080/demo/`.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   Database connection details are configured somewhere outside this code chunk.
    *   The Java UI tests use a `gradle.properties` file to configure settings like `chromedriver.path`.
*   **Architectural Patterns:**
    *   **Page Object Model (POM):** The Python Selenium tests (`basic_test.py`) explicitly use the POM pattern to create a reusable and maintainable abstraction over the UI. This is a best practice in UI automation.
    *   **Facade/Gateway (for testing):** The `ApiCalls.java` class acts as a client-side facade to the application's API, simplifying test setup.
*   **Testing Strategy:**
    *   **Unit Testing:** Java unit tests are written with JUnit and Mockito. `EqualsVerifier` is used to enforce `equals` and `hashCode` contracts on domain objects.
    *   **Parameterized Tests:** JUnit's `Parameterized` runner is used for testing algorithms (`Ackermann`, `Fibonacci`) with multiple inputs.
    *   **UI/E2E Testing:** A polyglot approach is used for end-to-end testing, indicating a sophisticated CI/CD pipeline or multiple teams with different skillsets.
        *   **Java:** Selenium WebDriver and HtmlUnit (for headless, non-JS tests).
        *   **Python (Behave):** BDD-style tests written in Gherkin syntax, providing living documentation of system features.
        *   **Python (Pytest):** Standard imperative UI tests using Selenium.
        *   **JavaScript:** Mocha and Selenium WebDriver.
        *   **C#:** NUnit and Selenium WebDriver.
*   **Service Dependencies:** The primary external dependency is a relational database. The application also depends on a database migration tool (inferred to be Flyway).
